    title: "Why Ticket guy?"
    image: "/images/me2.jpeg"
    content: |-
      8 years ago I have co-founded an open source project ([Alf.io](https://alf.io)) for managing registration and check-in of attendees at conferences.
      The project is currently being used by some of the biggest dev conference in Europe (Devoxx BE, Devoxx UK, Devoxx FR, Spring I/O, and several Voxxed Days).
      I've also founded a [company](https://swicket.io) to give commercial support to those conference organizers. This has become my side job.
      
      If you have attended one of those conferences, it's possible that you have met me at the check-in desk.
      If you will in the future, come and say hi!
      
      Some speakers refer to me as "The ticket guy", because I usually manage the "Speakers and troubleshooting" line at check-in. Now you know the reason why my website has this weird title.
